## Skills:
* Rigor
* Imperative programming.
* Graphics.
* Unix.


## Objectives:
* This project is a very small 2D game. Its purpose is to make you work with textures, sprites and some other very basic gameplay elements.
so long will help you improve your skills in the following areas: window management, event handling, colors, textures, and so forth.

* You are going to use the school graphical library: the MiniLibX! This library was developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events.

* The other goals are similar to every other goal for this first year: being rigorous, level up in C programming, use basic algorithms, do some information research, and so forth
